# heggartyindoeuropean
The goal of this project is to create one comparative dataset of several Indo European datasets taken from Heggarty et al. (2023), but also older datasets, such as the ones coded in List (2014), in order to have a
 first dataset that shows the same subset of data. The undertaking will be along the lines of the unpublished comparative study by Geisler and List (2010) that checks for the robustness of comparative datasets coded independently by different authors for cognates. The goal is to not only
 look at Indo-European, but at more datasets, using the toolchain for computer-assisted language comparison (Wu et al. 2020; Blum and List 2023). These tools are used to search for cognates and annotate words that are translated identically or with differences.
